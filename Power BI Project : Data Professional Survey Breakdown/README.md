* First we cleaned data in Power Query Editor like removing some columns, renaming it, filter out some values, replacing it, making new columns onthe basis of available columns, etc.
* Close and Apply.
* Open Report tab and do Visualizations
* Made Visualizations on fields like Job Title, Average Salary, Counts, Country, Happiness, Salary by Gender, Difficulty to break into data, etc.
* And used Visualizations are Stacked Bar Chart, Stacked Column Chart, Treemap, Gauge, Pie Chart, Donut Chart.
* Dashboard :
       Made Dashboard by combining and organizing all of the above Visualizations.
